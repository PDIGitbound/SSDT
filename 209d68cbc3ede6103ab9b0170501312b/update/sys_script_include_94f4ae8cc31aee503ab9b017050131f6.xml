            "Engine": "Temperature levels remain above expected limits during continuous operation, accompanied by reduced mechanical output and delayed response when subjected to repeated or heavy use.",
            "Harmonic Drive": "Movement irregularities were identified within a directional control assembly, marked by inconsistent movement intervals and unstable transitions between positions.",
            "Industrial PVC": "Structural elements made of thermoplastic material show bending, softening, and partial deformation, consistent with exposure to environmental or thermal conditions beyond rated thresholds.",
            "Servomotor": "Controlled movement sequences display reduced consistency, including brief unintended shifts and delays in positioning that affect overall coordination and system timing."
